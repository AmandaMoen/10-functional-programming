#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Amanda Moen worked on Lab 10. It took about 6 hours.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, I started by reading through each page (all the javascript pages, html pages, and the assignment README.md).
  2. Next, I added my conString to server.js
  3. Then, I wrapped articleView.js and article.js in IIFE's, and completed all of the TODO items.
  4. Finally, I updated the Article.fetchAll() for index.html, admin.html, and new.html.
